        Brew Haven began in 2020 with a simple belief: great coffee brings
        people together.

        Founded by two friends with a shared passion for exceptional coffee, we
        set out to create more than just another coffee shop. We envisioned a
        warm, welcoming space where the community could gather, where every cup
        would be crafted with care, and where the journey from bean to cup would
        be transparent and sustainable.

        Our beans are carefully selected from small farms that practice
        sustainable agriculture. We roast them in small batches to bring out
        their unique flavors, ensuring that every cup tells the story of its
        origin. Our baristas are not just employees; they're coffee enthusiasts
        trained in the art and science of brewing.

        Today, Brew Haven has become a beloved part of the Portland community.
        We're proud to serve not just coffee, but connection, comfort, and a
        little bit of joy in every cup.
