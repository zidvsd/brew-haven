# Contributing to Brew Haven

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This file is a short, starter guideline so contributors know how to open PRs and where to ask for help.

Guidelines

- Open an issue first to discuss larger changes or features.
- Create a descriptive branch name: `feature/your-feature` or `fix/issue-123`.
- Keep pull requests small and focused. Add screenshots or steps to reproduce when relevant.
- Run `npm run lint` before opening a PR.

Submitting a PR

1. Fork the repository and create a branch.
2. Make your changes and ensure lint passes.
3. Push your branch and open a pull request against the `main` branch.

If you are adding documentation or non-breaking changes, a short description is sufficient. For larger changes, include tests or a demo link.

If you want a more detailed contributor guide or a code of conduct added, please open an issue requesting those files.
